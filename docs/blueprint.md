## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #29335C. A deep, saturated blue suggests a traditional journalistic seriousness while stopping short of cliche.
- Background color: #E5E8EF. A very light, desaturated blue matching the hue of the primary will provide a calming effect.
- Accent color: #5C2933. A burgundy will call attention without being strident, analogous to the blue.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif. Headlines: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif. This pairing will ensure that blocks of text longer than a paragraph can be comfortably accomodated.
- Cards should have consistent padding and margins to provide a balanced and visually appealing layout.
- Subtle fade-in effects when loading new articles.
